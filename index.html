            <P>Any of the elements of pet care can be customized to your needs and what your dog accepts. Many dog owners, for instance, find that crate training is essential and that is where their dog spends much of its alone time. Then again, some people prefer more of an open living arrangement and train their dog to obey house rules without a crate. The key to remember is that if something is not working out, there's an alternative that you can try that might work perfectly with your pet. </P>
